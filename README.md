<h1> Text classification of pubmed abstracts on anticancer activity </h1>
<p>This repository contains files and information about the step 1 of Kaphta Architecture: Text classification of pubmed abstracts on anticancer activity. The text classification was based on ensemble method. In creation (training and tests) of the ensemble were selected four machine learning algorithms with better acuracy.  Bellow, there are information about the files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/ramongsilva/Text-classification-of-pubmed-abstracts-about-polyphenols-anticancer-activity/blob/main/Rotulated-corpus.rar'>Rotulated-corpus.rar</a>: pubmed abstracts textual corpus rotulated for training and tests of machine learning algorithms used in ensemble creation. These files are needed to execute the training-and-text-classification-gh.R script.</li>
